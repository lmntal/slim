/*
     The 'libzd' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed
  data.  This version of the library supports only one compression method
  (delta_deflation)
  NOTE: 'libzd' complies with the ZLIB Compressed Data Format Specification

     Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large
  enough (for example if an input file is mmap'ed), or can be done by
  repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter case, the
  application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

     The library does not install any signal handler. The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never
  crash even in case of corrupted input.

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT zd_deflate OF((zd_streamp strm, int flush));
/*
    zd_deflate compresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full. It may introduce some
  output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

    The detailed semantics are as follows. zd_deflate performs one or both of
  the following actions:

  - Compress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in and avail_in are updated and
    processing will resume at this point for the next call of zd_deflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly. This action is forced if the parameter flush is non zero.
    Forcing flush frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter
    should be set only when necessary (in interactive applications).
    Some output may be provided even if flush is not set.

  Before the call of zd_deflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating avail_in or avail_out accordingly; avail_out
  should never be zero before the call. The application can consume the
  compressed output when it wants, for example when the output buffer is full
  (avail_out == 0), or after each call of zd_deflate(). If deflate returns
  ZD_OK and with zero avail_out, it must be called again after making room in
  the output buffer because there might be more output pending.

    If the parameter flush is set to ZD_SYNC_FLUSH, all pending output is
  flushed to the output buffer and the output is aligned on a byte boundary, so
  that the decompressor can get all input data available so far. (In particular
  avail_in is zero after the call if enough output space has been provided
  before the call.)  Flushing may degrade compression for some compression
  algorithms and so it should be used only when necessary.

    If flush is set to ZD_FULL_FLUSH, all output is flushed as with
  ZD_SYNC_FLUSH, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can
  restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if
  random access is desired. Using ZD_FULL_FLUSH too often can seriously degrade
  the compression.

    If zd_deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called
  again with the same value of the flush parameter and more output space
  (updated avail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with
  non-zero avail_out).

    If the parameter flush is set to ZD_FINISH, pending input is processed,
  pending output is flushed and deflate returns with ZD_STREAM_END if there
  was enough output space; if deflate returns with ZD_OK, this function must be
  called again with ZD_FINISH and more output space (updated avail_out) but no
  more input data, until it returns with ZD_STREAM_END or an error. After
  deflate has returned ZD_STREAM_END, the only possible operations on the
  stream are zd_deflateReset or zd_deflateEnd.

    ZD_FINISH can be used immediately after zd_deflateInit if all the
  compression is to be done in a single step. In this case,
  a recommended value for avail_out is at least 0.1% larger than avail_in plus
  12 bytes - on some rare occasions zdelta may expand the data more than this,
  the application should check the return codes for those cases!
  If deflate does not return  ZD_STREAM_END, then it must be called
  again as described above.

    zd_deflate() sets strm->adler to the adler32 checksum of all input read
  so far (that is, total_in bytes).

     zd_deflate() returns ZD_OK if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), ZD_STREAM_END if all input has been
  consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to
  ZD_FINISH), ZD_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example
  if next_in or next_out was NULL), ZD_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible
  (for example avail_in or avail_out was zero).

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT inflateInit OF((z_streamp strm));

     Initializes the internal stream state for decompression. The fields
   next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by
   the caller. If next_in is not ZD_NULL and avail_in is large enough (the exact
   value depends on the compression method), zd_inflateInit determines the
   compression method from the zdlib header and allocates all data structures
   accordingly; otherwise the allocation will be deferred to the first call of
   inflate.  If zalloc and zfree are set to ZD_NULL, zd_inflateInit updates them to
   use default allocation functions.

     inflateInit returns ZD_OK if success, ZD_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, ZD_VERSION_ERROR if the zdelta library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller.  msg is set to null if there is no error
   message. inflateInit does not perform any decompression apart from reading
   the zdlib header if present: this will be done by zd_inflate().  (So next_in and
   avail_in may be modified, but next_out and avail_out are unchanged.)

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT zd_inflate OF((zd_streamp strm, int flush));
/*
    zd_inflate decompresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full. It may some
  introduce some output latency (reading input without producing any output)
  except when forced to flush.

  The detailed semantics are as follows. zd_inflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Decompress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in is updated and processing
    will resume at this point for the next call of zd_inflate().

  - Provide more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  zd_inflate() provides as much output as possible, until there
    is no more input data or no more space in the output buffer (see below
    about the flush parameter).

  Before the call of zd_inflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming
  more output, and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly.
  The application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for
  example when the output buffer is full (avail_out == 0), or after each
  call of zd_inflate(). If inflate returns ZD_OK and with zero avail_out, it
  must be called again after making room in the output buffer because there
  might be more output pending.

    If the parameter flush is set to ZD_SYNC_FLUSH, inflate flushes as much
  output as possible to the output buffer. The flushing behavior of inflate is
  not specified for values of the flush parameter other than ZD_SYNC_FLUSH
  and ZD_FINISH, but the current implementation actually flushes as much output
  as possible anyway.

    zd_inflate() should normally be called until it returns ZD_STREAM_END or an
  error. However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step
  (a single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to
  ZD_FINISH. In this case all pending input is processed and all pending
  output is flushed; avail_out must be large enough to hold all the
  uncompressed data. (The size of the uncompressed data may have been saved
  by the compressor for this purpose.) The next operation on this stream must
  be inflateEnd to deallocate the decompression state. The use of ZD_FINISH
  is never required, but can be used to inform inflate that a faster routine
  may be used for the single zd_inflate() call.

    zd_inflate() returns ZD_OK if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), ZD_STREAM_END if the end of the
  compressed data has been reached and all uncompressed output has been
  produced, ZD_DATA_ERROR if the input data was corrupted (input stream not
  conforming to the zlib/libzd format or incorrect adler32 checksum),
  ZD_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent (for example if
  next_in or next_out was NULL), ZD_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory,
  ZD_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible or if there was not enough room in
  the output buffer when ZD_FINISH is used.

    zd_inflateSync returns ZD_OK if a full flush point has been found,
  ZD_BUF_ERROR if no more input was provided, ZD_DATA_ERROR if no flush
  point has been found, or ZD_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was

  In the error case, the application may repeatedly call zd_inflateSync,

   An Adler-32 checksum is almost as reliable as a CRC32 but can be computed
   much faster. Usage example:
