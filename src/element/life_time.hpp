/**
 * A system for profiling object's lifetime.
 * Usage:
 *   Call LifetimeProfiler::check_memory_leak() after all objects are
 *   destructed. If any registered objects are not destructed (staying
 *   in a heap or a stack), the system prints stack traces when they are
 *   contsructed. To register objects to this system, call
 *   LifetimeProfiler::construct and LifetimeProfiler::destruct.
 *   For convenience, there is a class ProfileLifetime below. Inheriting
 *   the class enables us to automatically register objects of a derived
 *   class.
